This plugin adds an anchor to page and post permalinks, which can
point to an existant anchor in your template.

== Description ==

Set your anchor name in the options page.

Typical use case: a big picture in the header you don't want people
to be bothered with every time they click on an internal link. But
you still want that beautiful picture to be there :)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-permamod.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Changelog ==

= 0.2 =
* Now asks you for a custom anchor name

= 0.1 =
* Trivial, but still works.
