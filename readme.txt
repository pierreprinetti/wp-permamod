This plugin adds an anchor to page and post permalinks.

== Description ==

For now, it just appends "#content" to any post and page permalink.

Typical use case: a big picture in the header you don't want people
to be bothered with every time they click on an internal link. But
you still want that beautiful picture to be there :)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-permamod.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== Changelog ==

= 0.1 =
* Trivial, but still works.
